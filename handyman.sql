Try and plant tall growing plants towards the back of the garden and shorter ones in the front so that their sunlight does not get blocked.<br><br>When you are finally ready to begin planting your vegetable garden, make sure and plant at the right time of year.  If you are dying to get an early start, you may want begin your garden inside in a hotbed and then transplant when the weather permits.  After you are finished planting, make sure your vegetables receive the appropriate amount of water, which depends on the type of plant.  Most plants will need the equivalent to about an inch of water per week.<br><br>Weeds must be controlled in vegetable gardening because they will take up water, light, and nutrients meant for the vegetables and they often bring disease and insects to the garden.  You can get rid of weeds by cultivation or mulching.  To protect against disease and insects you can buy seeds that are disease resistant or use controlled chemicals.<br><br>Vegetable gardening is many people', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, '', '', 'vegetable-gardening.aspx'),

(172, 'Abc Of Soup Making', '', 'Lean, juicy beef, mutton, and veal, form the basis of all good soups; therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence, and such as are fresh-killed. Stale meat renders them bad, and fat is not so well adapted for making them. The principal art in composing good rich soup, is so to proportion the several ingredients that the flavour of one shall not predominate over another, and that all the articles of which it is composed, shall form an agreeable whole. To accomplish this, care must be taken that the roots and herbs are perfectly well cleaned, and that the water is proportioned to the quantity of meat and other ingredients. Generally a quart of water may be allowed to a pound of meat for soups, and half the quantity for gravies. In making soups or gravies, gentle stewing or simmering is incomparably the best. It may be remarked, however, that a really good soup can never be made but in a well-closed vessel, although, perhaps, greater wholesomeness is obtained by an occasional exposure to the air. Soups will, in general, take from three to six hours doing, and are much better prepared the day before they are wanted. When the soup is cold, the fat may be much more easily and completely removed; and when it is poured off, care must be taken not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the vessel, which are so fine that they will escape through a sieve. A tamis is the best strainer, and if the soup is strained while it is hot, let the tamis or cloth be previously soaked in cold water. Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened soups about the consistence of cream. To thicken and give body to soups and gravies, potato-mucilage, arrow-root, bread-raspings, isinglass, flour and butter, barley, rice, or oatmeal, in a little water rubbed well together, are used. A piece of boiled beef pounded to a pulp, with a bit of butter and flour, and rubbed through a sieve, and gradually incorporated with the soup, will be found an excellent addition. When the soup appears to be  too thin  or  too weak , the cover of the boiler should be taken off, and the contents allowed to boil till some of the watery parts have evaporated; or some of the thickening materials, above mentioned, should be added. When soups and gravies are kept from day to day in hot weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh scalded pans or tureens, and placed in a cool cellar. In temperate weather, every other day may be sufficient. <br><br>Various herbs and vegetables are required for the purpose of making soups and gravies. Of these the principal are, Scotch barley, pearl barley, wheat flour, oatmeal, bread-raspings, pease, beans, rice, vermicelli, macaroni, isinglass, potato-mucilage, mushroom or mushroom ketchup, champignons, parsnips, carrots, beetroot, turnips, garlic, shalots and onions. Sliced onions, fried with butter and flour till they are browned, and then rubbed through a sieve, are excellent to heighten the colour and flavour of brown soups and sauces, and form the basis of many of the fine relishes furnished by the cook. The older and drier the onion, the stronger will be its flavour. Leeks, cucumber, or burnet vinegar; celery or celery-seed pounded. The latter, though equally strong, does not impart the delicate sweetness of the fresh vegetable; and when used as a substitute, its flavour should be corrected by the addition of a bit of sugar. Cress-seed, parsley, common thyme, lemon thyme, orange thyme, knotted marjoram, sage, mint, winter savoury, and basil. As fresh green basil is seldom to be procured, and its fine flavour is soon lost, the best way of preserving the extract is by pouring wine on the fresh leaves. <br><br>For the seasoning of soups, bay-leaves, tomato, tarragon, chervil, burnet, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, mace, black and white pepper, essence of anchovy, lemon-peel, and juice, and Seville orange-juice, are all taken. The latter imparts a finer flavour than the lemon, and the acid is much milder. These materials, with wine, mushroom ketchup, Harvey''s sauce, tomato sauce, combined in various proportions, are, with other ingredients, manipulated into an almost endless variety of excellent soups and gravies. Soups, which are intended to constitute the principal part of a meal, certainly ought not to be flavoured like sauces, which are only designed to give a relish to some particular dish.', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, '', '', 'abc-of-soup-making.aspx'),
(173, 'The Principles Of Scientific Cookery', '', 'It is not enough that good and proper food material be provided; it must have such preparation as will increase and not diminish its alimentary value. The unwholesomeness of food is quite as often due to bad cookery as to improper selection of material. Proper cookery renders good food material more digestible. When scientifically done, cooking changes each of the food elements, with the exception of fats, in much the same manner as do the digestive juices, and at the same time it breaks up the food by dissolving the soluble portions, so that its elements are more readily acted upon by the digestive fluids. Cookery, however, often fails to attain the desired end; and the best material is rendered useless and unwholesome by a improper preparation. <br><br>It is rare to find a table, some portion of the food upon which is not rendered unwholesome either by improper preparatory treatment, or by the addition of some deleterious substance. This is doubtless due to the fact that the preparation of food being such a commonplace matter, its important relations to health, mind, and body have been overlooked, and it has been regarded as a menial service which might be undertaken with little or no preparation, and without attention to matters other than those which relate to the pleasure of the eye and the palate. With taste only as a criterion, it is so easy to disguise the results of careless and improper cookery of food by the use of flavors and condiments, as well as to palm off upon the digestive organs all sorts of inferior material, that poor cookery has come to be the rule rather than the exception. <br><br>Methods of cooking.<br>------------------- <br><br>Cookery is the art of preparing food for the table by dressing, or by the application of heat in some manner. A proper source of heat having been secured, the next step is to apply it to the food in some manner. The principal methods commonly employed are roasting, broiling, baking, boiling, stewing, simmering, steaming, and frying. <br><br>Roasting is cooking food in its own juices before an open fire.  Broiling, or grilling, is cooking by radiant heat. This method is only adapted to thin pieces of food with a considerable amount of surface. Larger and more compact foods should be roasted or baked. Roasting and broiling are allied in principle. In both, the work is chiefly done by the radiation of heat directly upon the surface of the food, although some heat is communicated by the hot air surrounding the food. The intense heat applied to the food soon sears its outer surfaces, and thus prevents the escape of its juices. If care be taken frequently to turn the food so that its entire surface will be thus acted upon, the interior of the mass is cooked by its own juices. <br><br>Baking is the cooking of food by dry heat in a closed oven. Only foods containing a considerable degree of moisture are adapted for cooking by this method. The hot, dry air which fills the oven is always thirsting for moisture, and will take from every moist substance to which it has access a quantity of water proportionate to its degree of heat. Foods containing but a small amount of moisture, unless protected in some manner from the action of the heated air, or in some way supplied with moisture during the cooking process, come from the oven dry, hard, and unpalatable. <br><br>Boiling is the cooking of food in a boiling liquid. Water is the usual medium employed for this purpose. When water is heated, as its temperature is increased, minute bubbles of air which have been dissolved by it are given off. As the temperature rises, bubbles of steam will begin to form at the bottom of the vessel. At first these will be condensed as they rise into the cooler water above, causing a simmering sound; but as the heat increases, the bubbles will rise higher and higher before collapsing, and in a short time will pass entirely through the water, escaping from its surface, causing more or less agitation, according to the rapidity with which they are formed. Water boils when the bubbles thus rise to the surface, and steam is thrown off. The mechanical action of the water is increased by rapid bubbling, but not the heat; and to boil anything violently does not expedite the cooking process, save that by the mechanical action of the water the food is broken into smaller pieces, which are for this reason more readily softened. But violent boiling occasions an enormous waste of fuel, and by driving away in the steam the volatile and savory elements of the food, renders it much less palatable, if not altogether tasteless. The solvent properties of water are so increased by heat that it permeates the food, rendering its hard and tough constituents soft and easy of digestion. <br><br>The liquids mostly employed in the cooking of foods are water and milk. Water is best suited for the cooking of most foods, but for such farinaceous foods as rice, macaroni, and farina, milk, or at least part milk, is preferable, as it adds to their nutritive value. In using milk for cooking purposes, it should be remembered that being more dense than water, when heated, less steam escapes, and consequently it boils sooner than does water. Then, too, milk being more dense, when it is used alone for cooking, a little larger quantity of fluid will be required than when water is used. <br><br>Steaming, as its name implies, is the cooking of food by the use of steam. There are several ways of steaming, the most common of which is by placing the food in a perforated dish over a vessel of boiling water. For foods not needing the solvent powers of water, or which already contain a large amount of moisture, this method is preferable to boiling. Another form of cooking, which is usually termed steaming, is that of placing the food, with or without water, as needed, in a closed vessel which is placed inside another vessel containing boiling water. Such an apparatus is termed a double boiler. Food cooked in its own juices in a covered dish in a hot oven, is sometimes spoken of as being steamed or smothered. <br><br>Stewing is the prolonged cooking of food in a small quantity of liquid, the temperature of which is just below the boiling point. Stewing should not be confounded with simmering, which is slow, steady boiling. The proper temperature for stewing is most easily secured by the use of the double boiler. The water in the outer vessel boils, while that in the inner vessel does not, being kept a little below the temperature of the water from which its heat is obtained, by the constant evaporation at a temperature a little below the boiling point. <br><br>Frying, which is the cooking of food in hot fat, is a method not to be recommended Unlike all the other food elements, fat is rendered less digestible by cooking. Doubtless it is for this reason that nature has provided those foods which require the most prolonged cooking to fit them for use with only a small proportion of fat, and it would seem to indicate that any food to be subjected to a high degree of heat should not be mixed and compounded largely of fats.', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', 0, '', '', 'the-principles-of-scientific-cookery.aspx'),

(273, 'Construction Cost Estimating: Common Sources Of Errors', '', 'Few cost estimates for bidding on construction projects are made that do not contain errors of one kind or another. Too many errors on the plus side can be a major reason for a bid not being competitive. Too may errors on the minus side can cause the contractor to lose money if awarded the contract.<br><br>Below are some of the most common sources of errors in construction cost estimating:<br><br>1. Errors in arithmetic: Estimates made on construction projects are arithmetical calculations of quantities and cost of materials and labor costs to install materials or perform various operations. In order to avoid errors in arithmetic, the estimator should use an electronic calculator with a recording tape, have the calculations checked by another person, and attach the tape to the estimate sheet for backup.<br><br>2. Taking Wrong Measurements from Plans and Specifications: Errors in measurements and dimensions taken from plans, drawings, and specifications result in corresponding mistakes in the cost of construction items based on those measurements.<br><br>3. Using the Wrong Wage Rates for Labor: Hourly labor wages for construction workers vary countrywide. You should consistently verify current wage rates and fringe benefits for the building trades involved through local union offices, other contractors, supply yards, and other reliable sources. Overtime rates are generally one and one-half to two times regular rates depending on labor agreements and union rules.<br><br>4. Insufficient or Excessive Allowances for Labor: A frequent cause of error in estimating is allowing too much or too little for labor to do the job.<br><br>5. Materials and Supplies Improperly Priced: Always be sure that building materials and supplies are correctly described as to kind, quality, size, and dimensions. Also confirm that they are priced competitively.<br><br>6. Using Incorrect Units of Measure: Using a wrong unit of measure can result in substantial cost increases or decreases. For example, be careful not to record lineal feet for lineal yards, square feet for square yards or cubic feet for cubic yards, and so forth.<br><br>7. Including Poorly Maintained Machinery or Equipment: Machinery or equipment to be used in construction, and included in the estimate or bid, must always be checked for efficient serviceability. Preparing an estimate on a construction project and contemplating the use of poorly maintained machinery or equipment is unwise. Breakdown, repairs, and idle time can be costly, delay completion of the project and invite penalties.<br><br>8. Failure to Visit the Project Site: This source of error might well be number one on the list because of its importance in the early stages of cost estimating. Visiting the proposed site of the project enables the cost estimator to inspect topography, check the soil by boring if necessary, determine if protection of adjacent properties will be needed, and check distances to railroad sidings, supply centers, and the proximity to sources of labor. If existing structures have to be demolished or removed from the premises, the estimator is able to properly determine the probable cost.<br><br>9. Overlooking or Miscalculating Haulage Costs: The cost of hauling materials, supplies, machinery, and equipment to a project can be a very expensive item in an estimate. Access to the job site may be difficult because of poor roads or no roads, heavy traffic to and from supply sources, or the requirement to obtain permits, and so forth.<br><br>10. Failure to Review Building Codes, Permits, and Inspections: Cost estimates and bids on construction projects are subject to local, state and federal building codes, permits, and inspections.<br><br>11. Failure to Consider Quality of Workmanship Required: A contractor who is accustomed to working on projects that require high quality workmanship may not be set up to bid or estimate projects of mediocre, low grade workmanship. Conversely, a contractor who usually works on cheap structures is frequently at a disadvantage when it comes to bidding on the construction of upscale residences or commercial buildings where only the finest quality of workmanship is acceptable. Failure to give proper consideration to the quality of workmanship a project warrants can lead to overestimating or underestimating.<br><br>12. Ommitting Items the Cost Estimator Considers to be Minor: Sometimes items such as scaffolding, ramps, and guardrails, are left out of an estimate on the assumption that their cost is relatively minor and can be absorbed in the overall bid. On small projects a contractor may gamble on his workers handling such items routinely. This can be a costly error.<br><br>13. Duplicating the Work of Subcontractors: Subcontractors often prepare their cost estimates from the plans and specifications without the guidance or supervision of the general contractor. They take off details and include all of the items they assume to fall within their particular trade. As a result there frequently is overlapping with the work of the general contractor or other subcontractors.<br><br>14. Failure to Review the Bids of Subcontractors: The owner looks to the general contractor for the completion of the work in compliance with the plans and specifications. The owner does not look to the subcontractors. It is very important that the estimates of subcontractors are carefully reviewed to be sure they comply with the plans and specifications.<br><br>15. Overlooking Items: The causes of overlooking items when preparing an estimate or bid are many. The following are typical:<br><br>a. Lack of attention to details.<br>b. In too great of a hurry to complete the cost estimate.<br>c. Too heavy a workload.<br>d. Basic lack of experience.<br>e. Delegating part of the estimate to others.<br>f. Failure to use a reliable checklist.<br><br>An important safeguard against overlooking items is to have another person independently review and double check the cost estimate.<br><br>16. Taking Shortcuts in Cost Estimating: Taking shortcuts when making an estimate can be risky. Often there is a temptation to take shortcuts when under pressure because of time-limit in which to complete the cost estimate or because of a heavy backlog of work. Shortcuts take the form of guesstimating, using square feet or cubic foot costs in place of details, and using lump sum figures picked out of the air, all of which have inherent risks.<br><br>17. Not Allowing for Realistic Contingencies: Some construction projects may have inherent and unusual problems that should be recognized when the cost estimate is being prepared. Failure to make the allowances or contingencies may result in not getting the contract or losing money if awarded the contract. These contingencies include severe winter weather conditions, or extremely hot and humid climates. The project may be located in an area of the country subject to heavy rainfall. Justifications for a realistic contingency include anticipated labor troubles, material shortages, or political problems.<br><br>18. Including Contingency Items Without Reason: A opposed to making allowances for realistic contingencies, it is poor policy to make flat allowances for contingencies without good reasons, particularly when competition is strong.<br><br>19.

For example an internal timber floor that adjoins a timber deck provides a material consistency that helps the space to feel as one.

However, this is not true and homeowners can actually make a significant financial mistake by re-financing at an inopportune time. There a couple of classic example of when re-financing is a mistake. This occurs when the homeowner does not stay in the property long enough to recoup the cost of re-financing and when the homeowner has had a credit score which has dropped since the original mortgage loan. Other examples are when the interest rate has not dropped enough to offset the closing costs associated with re-financing. <br><br>Recouping the Closing Costs<br><br>In determining whether or not re-financing is worthwhile the homeowner should determine how long they would have to retain the property to recoup the closing costs. This is significant especially in the case where the homeowner intends to sell the property in the near future. There are re-financing calculators readily available which will provide homeowners with the amount of time they will have to retain the property to make re-financing worthwhile. These calculators require the user to enter input such as the balance of the existing mortgage, the existing interest rate and the new interest rate and the calculator return results comparing the monthly payments on the old mortgage and the new mortgage and also supplies information about the amount of time required for the homeowner to recoup the closing costs. <br><br>When Credit Scores Drop<br><br>Most homeowners believe a drop in interest rates should immediately signal that it is time to re-finance the home. However, when these interest rates are combined with a drop in the credit score for the homeowner, the resulting re-financed mortgage may not be favorable to the homeowner. Therefore homeowners should carefully consider their credit score at the present time in comparison to the credit score at the time of the original mortgage.

This can be a mistake because the homeowner must first carefully evaluate whether or not the interest rate has dropped enough to result in an overall cost savings for the homeowners. Homeowners often make this mistake because they neglect to consider the closing costs associated with re-financing the home. These costs may include application fees, origination fees, appraisal fees and a variety of other closing costs.
